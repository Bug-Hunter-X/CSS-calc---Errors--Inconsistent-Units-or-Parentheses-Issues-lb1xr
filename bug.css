The CSS property `calc()` is used to perform calculations, but sometimes it can lead to unexpected results if the units are not consistent or if there are parentheses mismatches.  For example, `width: calc(100% - 10px);` is fine, but `width: calc(100% - 10);` will likely produce errors because '10' lacks a unit.
